	<!-- Since there are no S-98 extensions to the S-100 interoperability schema, this file is merely a wrapper which
		includes the S-100 interoperability catalogue schema and adds the S-98 schematron file. S-98 XML files should
		include the S-98 Schematron file to apply the S-98-specific constraints to S-98 interoperability catalogues.
