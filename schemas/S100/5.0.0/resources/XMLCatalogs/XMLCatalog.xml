Document history
Version 4.0.0-20200326	2020-03-26	Raphael Malyankar for NOAA
    Initial sample, prepared for use with S-100 4.0.0 generic schemas (FINAL) dated December 2018 and/or
    updated in May 2019. Maps broken ISO URLs for ISO 19136 and ISO 19139 schemas to the new locations on
    the ISO standards web site.
    Updated 22-Oct-2021 for 2021 ISO schemas by adding a rewrite for the path to the gmw files encoded in the
    ISO package from the ISO TC211 GitHub as of 18-Oct-2021.

<!-- Note:
     See the OASIS XML catalog standard for information on other kinds of rewrite rules. Report any
     other broken links in either the S-100 generic schemas or the ISO schemas used by them to Raphael.
     This file is an example and you can customize it for your local installation.
